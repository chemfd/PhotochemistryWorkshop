# Workshop Questions for Week 4 {#ch:Workshop3}

## Short conceptual question - Electronic-vibrational overlap integrals {#sec:overlap}

```{r echo=FALSE, overlap, out.width='70%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap='The grond and excited state potential wells and the vibrational levels within them.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/overlap.png")
```

On the figure sketch the vibrational energy levels in the ground and the excited state.

How would the following affect this overlap integral?
1. Energy gap.
1. The vibrational energy gaps
1. Reaction coordinate (the difference in structure between ground and excited state)

*(I will use drawing in UniDoodle to ask this in class, with the second part being a discussion question)*

## Short conceptual question - The effect of structural changes on quantum yield {#sec:structureQY}

5,10-dihydroindeno[2,1-a]indene and trans-stilbene (figure \@ref(fig:stilbeneindene)) are similar in structure but have very different fluorescent quantum yields of 1.00 and 0.05 respectively, however for trans-stilbene this increases to 0.75 at 77 K. Suggest a reason for the difference in quantum yield of:
    - the two molecules
    - the two temperatures
    
```{r echo=FALSE, stilbeneindene, out.width='60%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap='5,10-dihydroindeno[2,1-a]indene (left) and trans-stilbene (right)'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/stilbeneindene.png")
```

## Short mathematical question - Effect of the rate of singlet triplet intersystem crossing on th quantum yield of phosphorescence {#sec:ratephos}

Why is it likely that the quantum yield of phosphorescence of a sample would increase after the sample is frozen.

*(This will be a discussion question)*

## Short mathematical question - Determining the quantum yield of phosphorescence {#sec:calcphos}

A molecule decays by a combination of internal conversion, intersystem crossing and phosphorescence. What is the quantum yield of phosphorescence?

- k~IC~ = 2.1 × 10^11^ s^−1^
- k~ST~ = 2.9 × 10^9^ s^−1^
- k~TS~ = 7.4 × 10^6^ s^−1^
- k~p~^o^ = 6.2 × 10^8^ s^−1^

## Short conceptual question - Deactivation of excited state aromatic hydrocarbsons {#sec:exhydrocarbons}

Table: (\#tab:smallmolQY) The quantum yields of various deactivation processes in small organic molecules measured at 77 K in a glass matrix.

| | Φ~f~ | Φ~ST~ |  ΔE /  kJ mol^−1^|
|:--------------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| Napthalene | 0.20 | 0.80 | 385 |
| Anthracene | 0.70 | 0.30  | 318 |
| Pyrene | 0.6 | low | 322 |
| Tetracene | 0.1 | 0.65  | 251 |
| Pentacene | 0.10 | 0.15 | 209 |

When examining the data above suggest why it is likely why the quantum yields of both fluorescence and singlet to triplet intersystem crossing decrease with increasing molecule size.

*(This will be a discussion question)*

## Short conceptual question - Affect of deuteration of solvents. {#sec:dsolvent}

Singlet oxygen has a phosphorescence wavelength of around 1070 nm and a lifetime of 2 µs in water, how would you expect this lifetime to change for singlet oxygen in D~2~O?

*(This will be a discussion question)*

## Short conceptual question - Isotope effects on deactivation of an excited state {#sec:isotope}

The fluorescence quantum yield and singlet state lifetime of both proteated and deuterated pyrene  are 0.90 and 450 ns respectively. Why does deuteration of the sample have no measureable affect on these values?

Conversely for naphthalene phosphorescence (in glass at 77 K) the quantum yield of phosphoresce increases from 0.05 to ~0.80 on deuteration of the sample. (ΔE = 251  kJ mol^−1^ ). Explain this observation with respect to the energy gap law.

*(This will be a discussion question)*

## Short conceptual question - The effect of heavy attoms on the rate of intersystem crossing {#sec:heavy}

Table: (\#tab:heavyatom) The affect of substitution of different halogens on the rates of phosphorescence and singlet to triplet intersystem crossing.

| | k~p~ | k~ST~ |  Φ~p~ / Φ ~f~ |
|:--------------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| Napthalene | 0.05 | 0.39 | 0.09 |
| 1-fluoronaphthalene | 0.23 | 0.42 | 0.07 |
| 1-chloronaphthalene | 1.1 | 2.35 | 5.2 |
| 1-bromonaphthalene | 13.5 | 36.5 | 169 |
| 1-iodonaphthalene | 190 | 310 | >760 |

Briefly explain why the rates of these processes increase as we move down the group. 

*(This will be a discussion question)*


## Short conceptual question - The effect of absorbance and emission wavelengths on the quantum yield of emission {#sec:osphen}

Table: (\#tab:osphen) The spectroscopic details of a family of osmium complexes.

| | λ~abs~ / nm | λ~em~ / nm | ΔE / eV | τ/ ns | Φ~em~ |
|:----------------|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
| [Os(phen)~3~]^2+^ | 650 | 720 | 0.186 | 260 | 0.016 |
| [Os(phen)~2~(dppene)]^2+^ | 455 | 609 | 0.69 | 1830 | 0.138 |
| [Os(phen)(dppene)~2~]^2+^ | 400 | 530 | 0.761 | 3600 | 0.518 |

Why does the fluorescence lifetime increase as the phenanthroline ligands are replaced with dppene ligands?

*(This will be a discussion question)*
