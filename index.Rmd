# Welcome {-}

The notes have been prepared in a package called BookDown for RStudio so that the equations are accessible to screen readers. However, by providing the notes as a .html webpage I can also embed short videos to further describe some of the topics. Further you can download the questions (and later the answers, top left of the screen) in a format that suits you (either pdf or epub) to view offline, or change the way this document appears for ease of reading.

If you spot any typos or think there are any errors please let me know and I will do my best to fix them.

## Workshops for CH10009 {-}

The topics for LOILS each week are as follows:

- Week 1: General Q&A
- Week 2: Rearranging equations, units and standard form
- Week 3: Logarithms and exponentials
- Week 4: Tables and graphs
- Week 5: Calculus - differentiation - the basics and the chain rule
- Week 6: Calculus - differentiation - the product rule and partial differentiation
- Week 7: Calculus - integration - the basics and definite integrals
- Week 8: Some more examples of integration and revision

This 'book' will be updated weekly with workshop questions, answers will be provided and some answers will include 'process' as well as answer. Please contact me if you need help.

I am using this format as it is an accessible format.
