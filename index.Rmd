# Welcome {-}

The notes have been prepared in a package called BookDown for RStudio so that the equations are accessible to screen readers. However, by providing the notes as a .html webpage I can also embed short videos to further describe some of the topics. Further you can download the questions (and later the answers, top left of the screen) in a format that suits you (either pdf or epub) to view offline, or change the way this document appears for ease of reading.

## Workshops for Photochemistry & Photophysics {-}

This answerbook for CH30129 workshops will be updated weekly (hopefully the day after workshops) including thoughts and answers from you as a class. I will include video workthroughs of some answers, but others will be text based.

I am using this format as it is an accessible format.

## Version history {-}
