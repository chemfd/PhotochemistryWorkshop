However, by providing the notes as a .html webpage I can also embed short videos to further describe some of the topics. Further you can download the questions (and later the answers, top left of the screen) in a format that suits you (either pdf or epub) to view offline, or change the way this document appears for ease of reading. If you spot any typos or think there are any errors please let me know and I will do my best to fix them. Workshops for CH10009 The topics for LOILS each week are as follows: Week 1: General Q&amp;A Week 2: Rearranging equations, units and standard form Week 3: Logarithms and exponentials Week 4: Tables and graphs Week 5: Calculus - differentiation - the basics and the chain rule Week 6: Calculus - differentiation - the product rule and partial differentiation Week 7: Calculus - integration - the basics and definite integrals Week 8: Some more examples of integration and revision This ‘book’ will be updated weekly with workshop questions, answers will be provided and some answers will include ‘process’ as well as answer. Please contact me if you need help. I am using this format as it is an accessible format. Version history The initial commit of this book is dated 2nd October 2020. "],

Table 1.1: The seven base units from which all others are dervied. SI base unit symbol quantity symbol (dimension) quantity kilogram kg M mass metre m L length second s T time ampere A I electric current kelvin K Θ temperature mole mol N amount of substance candela cd J luminous intensity 1.1.2 SI Derived units Table 1.2: Some common SI derived units used in chemistry. symbol SI derived unit quantity SI base units other SI units Hz hertz frequency s-1 N newton force kg m s-2 Pa pascal pressure kg m-1 s-2 N m-2 J joule energy kg m2 s-2 N m W watt power kg m2 s-3 J s-1 C coulomb electrical charge A s V volt electrical potential kg m2 s-3 A-1 J C-1 F farad electrical capacitance kg-1 m-2 s4 A2 C V-1 Ω ohm electrical resistance kg m2 s-3 A-2 V A-1 S siemens electrical conductance kg-1 m-2 s3 A2 A V-1 or 1/Ω 1.1.3 Other units and conversion factors 1.1.4 SI prefixes and standard form In general lower case prefixes are used for negative powers and upper case prefixes are used for positive powers, however k (kilo) is an obvious exception to this rule. (Other exceptions are da (deca, 101) and h (hecto, 102)). Table 1.3: The more common SI prefixes used in chemistry.

Convert the following: 3.4 µm to mm and m 270.4 g mol-1 to kg mol-1 and yg (molecule-1) 23.4 μg dm−3 to mg dm−3, g m−3, and kg m−3 17.5 µHz to Hz 5796 cm-1 to µm-1 and m-1 If a box has dimensions 0.234 m x 34.5 cm x 26.8 mm. What is the volume of the box in: cm3? dm3? m3? Å3? The Gibbs free energy of a reaction, \\(\\Delta G\\) is given by equation (1.1). \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] Determine the value of \\(\\Delta G\\) at 40 ºC when the enthalpy of reaction, \\(\\Delta H\\) = -10.235 kJ mol-1 and the molar entropy, \\(\\Delta S\\) = +34 J K-1 mol-1 1.2.2 Determining units of variables in equations Answers for these questions are in Section 1.3.1. The ideal gas equation is given in equation (1.2). \\[\\begin{equation} pV = n\\textrm{R}T \\tag{1.2} \\end{equation}\\] The units of the variables are: \\(p\\) (pressure), Pa (pascals) \\(V\\) (volume), m3 \\(n\\) (number of moles), mol \\(T\\) (absolute temperature), K Determine the SI base units of the gas constant, R. Determine the pressure of 1.00 mmol of an ideal gas that occupies 1.65 dm3 at 25 ºC. The famous Einstein equation \\(E=mc^2\\) is more properly written as: \\[\\begin{equation*} E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m_0^2 c^4 \\end{equation*}\\] Determine the units of the variable \\(p\\). At low temperatures the molar heat capacity of a material \\(c_{p, m}\\) (J K-1 mol-1) is given by equation (1.3). \\[\\begin{equation} c_{p, m}= a T^3 \\tag{1.3} \\end{equation}\\] Determine the units of the constant, a. Determine the units of the coulomb constant, \\(k_e\\), in equation (1.4), given that r is the separation of two charges, F the force of attraction between the two charges, and \\(q_x\\) is teh charge (in coulombs, C) on each of the particles. \\[\\begin{equation} F = k_e \\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \\tag{1.4} \\end{equation}\\] 1.3 Answers 1.3.1 Unit conversion answers 3.4 × 10-3 mm; 3.4 × 10-6 m 0.2704 kg mol-1; 449.0 yg 23.4 × 10-3 mg dm−3; 23.4 × 10-3 g m−3; and 23.4 × 10-6 kg m−3 17.5 × 10-6 Hz 0.5796 µm-1 and 5.796 × 105 m-1 2.16 × 103 cm3 2.16 dm3 2.16 × 10-3 m3 2.16 × 1027 Å3 0.0 kJ mol-1 - please note this value is correct to the appropriate sig figs 1.3.2 Determining units of variables in equations answers kg m2 s-2 K-1 mol-1 (this is more ususally written as J K-1 mol-1) 1.50 kPa m s-1 J K-4 mol-1 kg m3 s-4 A-2 or N m2 C-2 "]
