However, by providing the notes as a .html webpage I can also embed short videos to further describe some of the topics. Further you can download the questions (and later the answers, top left of the screen) in a format that suits you (either pdf or epub) to view offline, or change the way this document appears for ease of reading. Workshops for Photochemistry &amp; Photophysics This answerbook for CH30129 workshops will be updated weekly (hopefully the day after workshops) including thoughts and answers from you as a class. I will include video workthroughs of some answers, but others will be text based. I am using this format as it is an accessible format. Version history Updated to include workshop week 2 questions 021020 Typos on workshop 1 were fixed 280920 The initial commit of this book is dated 25th September 2020. "],

(I will use MCQs and UniDoodle to ask this in class) 1.2 Short conceptual question - molar extinction coefficient Modify the molecule in figure 1.1 to increase the molar extinction coefficient (do not worry about what may happen to wavelength). Figure 1.1: The structure of bipyridine (also known as bpy). (I will use UniDoodle’s drawing feature to ask this in class) 1.3 Short conceptual question - intensity of colour What factors influence the ‘intensity of colour’ of the following solutions? Figure 1.2: The structures of the organic dye methylene blue (left), potassium permanganate (centre) and copper hexa-aqua (right). Figure 1.3: 1 mM solutions of the organic dye methylene blue (right), potassium permanganate (centre) and copper hexa-aqua (left). (This will be a discussion question - please feel free to raise a hand or write comments in the zoom chat) 1.4 Short conceptual question - line width Why are some spectra very broad (figure 1.4), whereas others have sharp peaks (figure 1.5)? You will need to look at the x-scale to truley note the difference in the width of these emission spectra. Figure 1.4: The emission spectrum of rhodamine 6G Figure 1.5: The emission spectrum of Sn(II) (This will be a discussion question - please feel free to raise a hand or write comments in the zoom chat) 1.5 Short conceptual question - the effect of solvation on absorbance Figure 1.6: Ethidium bromide dissolved in from right; water(orange), methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol(purple) Why does the observed colour of ethidium bromide depend upon the solvent (figure 1.6))? Think about the effect of solvation on the energy levels and why those energy levels matter! Remember that if light is transmitted through a solution that is the colour we observe… (This will be a discussion question - please feel free to raise a hand or write comments in the zoom chat) 1.6 Extended question - Azobenzene Azobenzene undergoes the following cis-trans isomerisation, the isomerisation occurs in the ps timescale. Figure 1.7: The cis-trans isomerisation of azobenzene Why would you expect the absorption spectrum of each isomer to be different? Suggest why the trans conformation is more stable than the cis isomer. Use the following data to predict the proportion of each isomer under 360 nm excitation. Table 1.1: The molar extinction coefficient of the two isomers of azobenzene. ε360 / M−1 cm−1 ε460 / M−1 cm−1 trans-azobenzene 22000 4500 cis-azobenzene 2100 5500 Would there be more or less trans azobenzene at 460 nm? Justify your answer. It has been suggested the 360 nm absorption is an S0 → S2 absorption, and the 460 nm band is an S0 → S1 absorption. Suggest which energy levels are involved for each of the two transitions and compare it to stilbene which has a similar structure, but the cis and trans absorptions are 280 &amp; 295 nm respectively. Figure 1.8: The structure of stilbene (This will be a discussion question - please feel free to raise a hand or write comments in the zoom chat. I don’t expect to finish this question but hope to get far enough through that a good attempt can be made at home after the LOIL) "],

What is the natural lifetime? (I will use MCQs and UniDoodle to ask this in class) 2.2 Short conceptual question - Effect of other processes For a given value of τ0 what happens to the lifetime and quantum yield as kIC and kISC increases? (This will be a discussion question - please feel free to raise a hand or write comments in the zoom chat) 2.3 Conceptual question - Effect of structure {sec:structure} Fluorescein (figure 2.1) in basic aqueous solution has a quantum yield of fluorescence, Φf, of 0.95, and fluorescence lifetime, τf, of 4.1 ns. Figure 2.1: The structure of the fluorescent molecule fluorescein (This will be a discussion question - please feel free to raise a hand or write comments in the zoom chat) 2.4 Conceptual question - lack of symmetry in spectra. The absorption and emission spectrum of fluorescein is shown in figure (2.2) Figure 2.2: The absorption (solid) and emission (dashed) spectrum of fluorescein in basic ethanol. Why are the absorption bands between 200 – 350 nm not reflected in the emission spectrum? 2.5 Conceptual question - Stokes’ shift The inorganic dye [Ru(bpy)3]2+ has a measured lifetime in water of 580 ns and a natural lifetime of 13.8 µs. The spectrum is shown in figure 2.3. What is the origin of the large Stokes’ shift in this system? Figure 2.3: The absorption (black) and emission (red) spectrum of ruthenium tris bypyridine in water. Data from Shi et al., Synthesis and characterization of phosphorescent two coordinate copper(I) complexes bearing diamidocarbene ligands. Dalton Trans., 2017,46, 745-752. 2.6 Conceptual question - the effect of binding on emission The asymmetric cyanine dye YO-Pro-1 is a DNA stain because it has a large increase on fluorescence emission when binding to DNA. The lifetime in free solution is around 2 ps and when bound to DNA is 2.4 ns. What is the structural origin of the large increase of emission upon binding? Figure 2.4: The emission spectrum of the choromophore YO-Pro-1 when free in aqueous solution (blue) and when bound to DNA (pink) (This will be a discussion question - please feel free to raise a hand or write comments in the zoom chat) 2.7 Extended question - Properties of Ethidium Bromide (Example Exam Question) Ethidium bromide (EB, figure 2.5 is used as a DNA stain, which is essentially non-fluorescent in aqueous solution, but shows a strong enhancement of emission upon binding to double stranded DNA (which has a negatively charged backbone). Emission is almost exclusively from the singlet excited state, but a triplet state has been shown to exist, which emits with a low quantum yield (ΦP = 0.00006). Figure 2.5: The structure of the cationic ethidium bromide chromophore. Sketch a Jablonski diagram for the processes you know to occur. The molar extinction coefficient, ε, of EB has be measured to be 78500 M−1 cm−1. What factors contribute to EB having such a high extinction coefficient? The following spectra, lifetimes and quantum yield have been measured for EB in different free solution and DNA systems: Table 2.1: The lifetimes and quantum yields of ethidium bromide in aquous solution and when bound to DNA in protiated and deuterated systems. τ / ns Φf H2O (no DNA) 1.6 0.012 D2O (no DNA) 6.3 DNA 28.3 0.220 DNA (deuterated) 38.4 Figure 2.6: The absorption (black) and emission (pink) spectrum of ethidium bromide when bound to DNA. What factors likely lead to an enhancement of fluorescence quantum yield upon binding to DNA? Show that the natural lifetime of EB is 129 ns. What is the origin of the large Stoke’s shift (λ~max ex~ = 520 nm, λ~max em~ = 608 nm) What transitions are responsible for the absorption features in the: * 400-600 nm range * 200-350 nm range Why are the features in the 200-350 nm range not replicated in the emission spectrum? Why does deuterating the solvent (or DNA) effect the lifetime of the excited state? What effect would freezing the samples have on the lifetime, fluorescence quantum yield &amp; phosphorescence quantum yield. A study of the thermodynamics of the dye DNA system measured the binding constant of EB with DNA to be 1.05 × 106. Why is the measured quantum yield for a system containing 2 µM EB and 20 mM DNA only 0.18? Why would increasing the ionic strength of the solution, increase the fluorescence intensity of EB in solution with DNA? "]
