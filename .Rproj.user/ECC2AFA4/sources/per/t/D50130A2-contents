# Workshop Questions for Week 5 {#ch:Workshop5}

## Short conceptual question - O2 quenching {#sec:O2quench}

1. Given molecular oxygen has an emission with λ~max~ around 1280 nm why is it such a good quencher of excited states?

1. Why is the efficiency of quenching lower for excited singlet states?

*Are you all happy with the energy level diagram of molecular oxygen?*

*(This will be a discussion question - please feel free to raise a hand or write comments in the zoom chat)*

## Short mathematical question - Förster resonance energy transfer {#sec:FRET}

A donor, D, with an unquenched lifetime of 5.0 ns, was found to have a steady state emission intensity of 20.5 in free solution and 4.1 when in the presence of a quencher, Q. Assuming the Förster distance is 50 Å determine :

1. the transfer efficiency, E.
1. the lifetime of D in the presence of the quencher Q
1. the equilibrium separation of D & Q
1. the rate constant for energy transfer

## Short conceptual quesiton - Förster distance {#sec:FRETdist}

Determine the quantum yield of emission of the donor in a FRET pair system where donor and acceptor are separated by the Förster distance, the lifetime of the unquenched system is 8.4 ns. The unquenched quantum yield is 0.58*


*(I will poll this question on UniDoodle and then maybe discuss some of the responses)*


## Short conceptual quesiton - Donor-accceptor system {#sec:donoracceptor}

In a single molecule study of a donor bound to an acceptor via a flexible, short aliphatic chain it was found that lifetime of the excited state varied (time beween single photon detection of emission after an excitation pulse). Suggest why this is the case.

## Short conceptual quesiton - Quenching of ruthenium {#sec:ruquench}

Ruthenium tris bipyridine [Ru(bpy)~3~]^2+^ has a  λ~max, abs~ = 470 nm and λ~max, em~ = 465 nm. The natural lifetime is 13.6 µs.

Suggest why molecular oxygen is an efficient quencher of the emmission of [Ru(bpy)~3~]^2+^.

## Short conceptual question - Energy transfer and spectra {#sec:spectra}

How would you expect the absorption and emission spectra observed in an experiment to change when an emmisive acceptor is added?

If you keep the emisison wavelength the same and scan the intensity of this band with changing excitation wavelength how will this (excitation) spectrum vary from the absorbance and how can it be used to confirm energy transfer?

## Short conceptual question - Effect of separation {#sec:FRETDNA}

A 'cyanine-3' and 'cyanine-5' are cyanine dyes which are frequently used as markers in experiments with DNA. 

Cyanine-3 has a λ~max, abs~ = 554 nm and λ~max, em~ = 568 nm

Cyanine-5 has a λ~max, abs~ = 649 nm and λ~max, em~ = 666 nm

In an experiment they are tethered to either end of a DNA oligomer of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 11 & 12 base pairs. However the pattern expected of increasing lifetime as the separation increased was not observed. Suggest why this may be occuring.
