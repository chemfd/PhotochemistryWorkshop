# Workshop Questions for Week 6 {#ch:Workshop6}

## Short conceptual question - change in behaviour on freezing

As the concentration of a species increases the wavelength of emission increases in the solution phase but this same shift in wavelength is not when the solution is frozen. What photochemical process may be occuring to explain this effect?

## Short conceptual question - effect of polar solvents on emission

Solutions containing anthracence and diethylaniline are shown to have broad emission at around 450 nm in toluene, but in dichloromethane no emission is observed.

The emission from athracene has λ~max~ of 375 nm.

Suggest the processes going on which account for these observations.

## Short conceptual question - isoemissive point  

As the concentration of pyrene dissolved in toluene increases a new broad band with a broad featureless spectrum is observed, which is from excimer emisison. What evidence is there that emission is only from single molecule and excimer emission and no other states?

How would the absorption spectrum change as the concentration increases?

## Short conceptual question - redox chemistry

Why does formation of an excited state decrease both the oxidation and reduction potential of a species?

## Short conceptual question - effect of time delay

If a solution of pyrene in cyclohexane is excited with a very short (ps) pulse of lightafter 1 ns the emission spectrum observed is mainly that of the momomer, whereas after 100 ns emission is principally from the excimer. Why is this the case?

## Short conceptual question - lifetimes

The emission spectra of 2-phenylindole shows a marked difference with changes in concentration. 

At a concentration of 1 × 10^−5^ M the measured lifetime is 0.86 ns, whereas at 5 × 10^−3^ M the measured lifetime is 3.42 ns.

```

Why does the measured lifetime depend upon concentration?
